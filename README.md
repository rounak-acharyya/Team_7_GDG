Project Description : This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize traffic management for emergency vehicles by predicting congestion and suggesting real-time route adjustments. The model is trained using NYC Open Data and employs a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for traffic volume prediction.
How It Works? 
1️.  Preprocess traffic data (time, location, borough, direction, and volume).
2️.  Train the ML model to predict traffic congestion patterns.
3️.  Use real-time GPS coordinates to check ambulance locations.
4️.  Predict congestion levels and recommend whether to deploy an emergency lane.
5️.  Visualize insights on a Streamlit-based dashboard.
